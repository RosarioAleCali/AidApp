# AidApp
The AidApp is a C++ program that I have developed as a project for my BTP200 class (The Object-Oriented Paradigm Using C++)
at Seneca College during Winter 2016. The program is heavily based on OOP principles and strong user input validation.
The program reads raw data from a file and then it initializes objects dynamically into an array.
Once all the objects are loaded a simple CLI menu is displayed.
Some of the menu options are adding products (perishable or non-perishable), adding quantity to products, list products and,
search and display one product.
Every change will be saved to a file so that next time the objects are ready to be loaded.
From a techinal point of view the program is heavily based on classes and inheritance. Basic dynamic memory is also used 
to create new objects. Every product class implemeants the rule of three.
